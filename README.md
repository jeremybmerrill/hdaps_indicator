This is a simple Unity indicator for laptops with HDAPS -- Hard Drive Active Protection System. I think this is only some Apple and Lenovo laptops. I use the tp_smapi module on my Lenovo laptop, but YMMV.


####Install
You have to move the icons into /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/devices and then regenerate the GTK icon cache before the icon shows up. See INSTALL for more info.

####Usage
You can turn off or on the notifications.

####License
This software is available under a GPL v3 license, see the included LICENSE file. The icons are licensed under CC BY 3.0; and Hard Drive symbol by the [Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com Noun Project).

#### Credits
This software is based almost entirely off of [Michael Orlitzky's xfce4 hdaps indicator](http://michael.orlitzky.com/code/xfce4-hdaps.php/ xfce4-hdaps), and [Julien Lavergne's AWN HDAPS indicator](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~awn-extras/awn-extras/trunk/files/head:/applets/maintained/thinkhdaps/ awn-extras/thinkhdaps) and [Ubuntu's sample Python Unity indicator](http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/technologies/application-indicators/ Unity).
UbuntuForums user typhoon_tip wrote some of the notification code.
