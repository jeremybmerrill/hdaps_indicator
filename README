This is a simple Unity indicator for laptops with HDAPS -- Hard Drive Active Protection System. I think this is only some Apple and Lenovo laptops. I use the tp_smapi module on my Lenovo laptop, but YMMV.

This software is available under a GPL v3 license, see the included LICENSE file. The icons are licensed under CC BY 3.0; and Hard Drive symbol by the [Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com Noun Project).

This software is based almost entirely off of [Michael Orlitzky's xfce4 hdaps indicator](http://michael.orlitzky.com/code/xfce4-hdaps.php/ xfce4-hdaps), and [Julien Lavergne's AWN HDAPS indicator](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~awn-extras/awn-extras/trunk/files/head:/applets/maintained/thinkhdaps/ awn-extras/thinkhdaps) and [Ubuntu's sample Python Unity indicator](http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/technologies/application-indicators/ Unity).

Pull requests and questions are welcomed. :)
